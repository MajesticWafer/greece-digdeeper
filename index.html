        <h2>The Athenian Navy - Asset Importance</h2>
        <p>Athens had developed a strong navy amongst its struggle against the Persian Empire. During the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, Athenian soldiers helped halt one of the many invading armies from Persia on the Plains of Marathon. An Athenian politician known as Themistocles, rose to power soon afterwards.</p>

        <h2>The War Against Persia - Athenian Smarts</h2>
        <p>Themistocles desired to make Athens great, and did so by exploiting what he perceived to be one of Persia’s biggest weaknesses – their navy. He proceeded to talk the Athenians into the value of building their own navy. They agreed, and their legend was born. Athens used money generated from their silver deposits to build ships and train the soldiers who would fight in the navy.</p>

        <h2>Title 3</h2>
        <p>Of all the Greek states, the one of which stands out as particularly devoted to maritime life is Athens. Partly, this is due to the surviving literary evidence, which is oriented very strongly towards Athens. Other Greeks, however, recognized the superiority of Athenian skills at sea. This Athenian naval reputation had resulted largely from the singular role played by the Athenian fleet in the defeat of the Persians at Salamis in 480 and also from the Athenian maritime empire which enjoyed hegemony in the Aegean following the Persian Wars.</p>
